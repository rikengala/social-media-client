## Social Media Client

This is a React Web App where I am trying to create a Twitter clone.
The app allows users to post, check user timelines, like or comment on posts.

To run the app in your local environment, clone the repository and in the project directory, you can run:

## npm start

This will run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
